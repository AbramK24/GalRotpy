# GalRotpy

A Python-based tool for parametrizing the rotation curve and the galaxy potential of disk-like galaxies.


GalRotpy is intended to the understanding of the contributions of each mass component to the gravitational potential of disk-like galaxies and in the corresponding rotation curve. This software is presented as a pedagogical tool for supporting the following research areas: galactic dynamics, cosmology and gravitation.

GalRotpy requires essentially galpy package and it entails mainly three python packages: Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. GalRotpy supports Python2.7.
